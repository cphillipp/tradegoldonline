Great for when you would like to hide an admin menu from a user so that they will not accidentally click the menu item.

== Description ==

Sometimes you have users with admin rights that you do not want clicking on certain menu items such as pages, posts, settings etc.

Plugin Features:

*   View a list of users and what menus they will have hid from them.
*   You can also hide items from yourself
*   There is even an option to hide this plugin from all users so they can't change their own "permissions".

    Please note that if the user is savvy enough to enter in the url such as (http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=page for pages)
Then they will be able to go there. This plugin is mainly to hide the menu items form inexperienced users that you do not want in certain menus
either because it will confuse them or because you just do not want them there.

== Installation ==

Installation is easy.
Install from wordpress and you are done.

If uploading the plugin .zip file to your site:

1. Browse for plugin's .zip file.
2. Install


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I have locked myself out of the plugin and cannot unhide it? =

Manually type in your plugin directory, such as "http://yoursite.com/wp-admin/plugins.php" and deactivate plugin.
Then it will clear all users that have been added.

= How do I hide menus that have been added by plugins? =

You must find the css id for that menu. A great tool to use to find it would be firebug (getfirebug.com) to
find the css id. It will look something like "li id="toplevel_page_plugin"
